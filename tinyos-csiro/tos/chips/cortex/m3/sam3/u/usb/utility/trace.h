/// \unit
///
/// !Purpose
///
/// Standard output methods for reporting debug information, warnings and
/// errors, which can be easily be turned on/off.
///
/// !Usage
/// -# Initialize the DBGU using TRACE_CONFIGURE() if you intend to eventually
///    disable ALL traces; otherwise use DBGU_Configure().
/// -# Uses the TRACE_DEBUG(), TRACE_INFO(), TRACE_WARNING(), TRACE_ERROR()
///    TRACE_FATAL() macros to output traces throughout the program.
/// -# Each type of trace has a level : Debug 5, Info 4, Warning 3, Error 2
///    and Fatal 1. Disable a group of traces by changing the value of 
///    TRACE_LEVEL during compilation; traces with a level bigger than TRACE_LEVEL 
///    are not generated. To generate no trace, use the reserved value 0.
/// -# Trace disabling can be static or dynamic. If dynamic disabling is selected
///    the trace level can be modified in runtime. If static disabling is selected
///    the disabled traces are not compiled.
///
/// !Trace level description
/// -# TRACE_DEBUG (5): Traces whose only purpose is for debugging the program, 
///    and which do not produce meaningful information otherwise.
/// -# TRACE_INFO (4): Informational trace about the program execution. Should  
///    enable the user to see the execution flow.
/// -# TRACE_WARNING (3): Indicates that a minor error has happened. In most case
///    it can be discarded safely; it may even be expected.
/// -# TRACE_ERROR (2): Indicates an error which may not stop the program execution, 
///    but which indicates there is a problem with the code.
/// -# TRACE_FATAL (1): Indicates a major error which prevents the program from going
///    any further.
